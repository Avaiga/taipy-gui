# Graphical User Interface User Manual

Taipy can generate a graphical user interface for you, if you want one.

A graphical user interface is made of generated Web pages that are served by a Web server
hosted by the Taipy application itself, using the `Gui` class.

The generated Web pages are build from a set of template text files that you provide,
where you would have planted placeholders to hold _controls_. Taipy comes with two
template formats, handled by the classes [Markdown](../../reference/#taipy.gui.renderers.Markdown)
and [Html](../../reference/#taipy.gui.renderers.Html).

There are many different controls that can be used in any given page, and all are described
in the [Controls](controls.md) section.
