# About Taipy user manuals

This User Manual covers all the topics and concepts that you can find in Taipy.
For each topic, we are trying to provide as many examples as possible so that
you as a Taipy developer can perform a specific task.

If you are just starting with Taipy, you may want to look at the [Getting Started document](/../getting_started/installation.md)
in order to see a complete example of a complete Taipy application, described step-by-step.

## Graphical User Interface

Taipy comes with a package (`taipy.gui`) that allows for building user interfaces. The
Graphical User Interface section will provide you with all the information
you need to create pages that you can display and interact with.
