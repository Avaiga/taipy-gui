# Taipy tools

This directory contains files that are consumed by tools that are used to
build, test or document Taipy.

- `mkdocs`: is the directory where mkdoc-specific files are located.
   This is what is used to build Taipy's documentation
- `generate_controls_ref.py`: a Python script that merges the reference
  documentation for Taipy controls, that can be found in <taipy>/gui/doc.
