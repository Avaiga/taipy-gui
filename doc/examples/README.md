# Taipy GUI Examples

This directory contains an organized set of Python script files that can
be executed, as long as the taipy-gui package is installed.

These script files are examples of how to build simple Taipy GUI applications,
to demonstrate specific features of the taipy-gui package.

These examples are organized by theme under this directory and are referenced
from the [Taipy documentation](https://docs.taipy.io/en/latest/).
