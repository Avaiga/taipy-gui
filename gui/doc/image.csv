is transferred depends on the the <i>data_url_max_size</i> parameter of the application
configuration (which is set to 50kB by default):
<ul>
<li>If the size of the buffer is smaller than this setting, then the raw content is generated as a
  data URL, encoded using base64 (i.e. <code>""data:&lt;mimetype&gt;;base64,&lt;data&gt;""</code>).</li>

  file.</li>
