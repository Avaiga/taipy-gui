*columns,str,"""1 1""","The list of weights for each column.
For example, `""1 2""` creates a 2 column grid:
<ul>
<li>1fr</li>
<li>2fr</li>
</ul>
The creation of multiple same size columns can be simplified by using the multiply sign eg. ""5*1"" is equivalent to ""1 1 1 1 1""."
columns[mobile],str,"""1""","The list of weights for each column, when displayed on a mobile device.
The syntax is the same as for <i>columns</i>."
gap,str,"""0.5rem""",The size of the gap between the columns.
