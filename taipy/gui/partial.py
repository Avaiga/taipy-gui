    Partials are used when you need to use a partial page content in different
    and not related pages. This allows not to have to repeat yourself when
    creating your page templates.

    Visual elements such as [`dialog`](../gui/viselements/dialog.md) or
    [`pane`](../gui/viselements/pane.md)] can use Partials.
    
    Note that `Partial` has no constructor (no `__init__()` method): to create a
    Partial, you must call the `Gui.add_partial()^` function.
