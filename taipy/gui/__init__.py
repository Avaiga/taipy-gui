"""# Taipy Graphical User Interface generator.

The Taipy Gui package provides User Interface generation based on
page templates. It can run a Web server that a Web browser can connect
to.

The pages are generated by a Web server that allows Web clients to
connect, display and interact with the page content through visual
elements.

Each page can contain regular text and images, as well
as Taipy controls that are typically linked to some
value that is managed by the whole Taipy application.

Here is how you can create your first Taipy User Interface:

   - Create a Python source file.
     Copy these two lines into a file called _taipy.py_.
     ```py
     from taipy import Gui
     Gui("# Hello Taipy!").run()
     ```
   - Install Taipy:
     ```
     pip install taipy
     ```
   - Run your application:
     ```
     python taipy.py
     ```

Your browser opens a new page, showing the content of your graphical
application.
